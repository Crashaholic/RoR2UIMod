# UIModifier
With Path Of Exile: Delirium releasing Soon :tm:, I wanted to try out some more modding on Risk Of Rain 2 before I sink my time into that game.

## What it does
Turns the health ***bar*** into a health ***globe***. Just like what it looks like in Path Of Exile, with the difference really just being the art.

## Known issues
- Ordering of the canvases are off.

 *\~\~To add on\~\~*

## Planned
- Change the EXP bar as well (present in source code, just needs some work).
- Change the skills display thingamajig.
- ... and leave the rest of the HUD alone.
